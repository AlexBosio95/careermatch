# CareerMatch

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

CareerMatch is an open-source, Docker-ready proof of concept that compares a CV with a LinkedIn job post and generates a structured fit report, including a score, strengths, gaps, and actionable suggestions.

This project intentionally uses **only free LLM models available on OpenRouter** and is built on top of the **datapizza-ai framework**.

CareerMatch is **not a production-ready application**, but an experimental playground to explore CV–job matching strategies, prompt design, and deterministic post-processing.

The project is and will remain **fully open source**. Suggestions, improvements, and contributions are welcome.
